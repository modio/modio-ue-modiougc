**ModioUGC** (along with ModioUGCEditor) is a module that facilitates pak file loading and unloading for Unreal Engine projects.

:::caution
This plugin is currently released in an experimental state. Functionality is subject to change. Please use with caution in production environments.
:::

UGC is authored as a content-only plugins. Each plugin represents a piece of UGC, where content such as textures, meshes, blueprints, etc., can be added. The UGC plugin is then packaged into the following files:

- A `.pak` file (always created)
- `.ucas` and `.utoc` files (created when Io Store is used)
- An accompanying `.uplugin` file for mounting at runtime

This process is similar to how the Project Launcher packages a plugin as DLC. The packaged UGC can be compressed, optionally uploaded to mod.io, downloaded, and applied in-game using the runtime module.

## What's included

It features two main modules:

- **Editor Module**: Handles UGC creation, management, and packaging.
- **Runtime Module**: Manages mounting of mods (pak files) to the game.
